# Predicting Diabetes Mellitus with MATLAB&reg;
This repository contains code and instructions enable you to develop machine learning algorithms that can predict if a patient admitted to the ICU has diabetes mellitus based on clinical data. Admittance in the ICU can be a chaotic and stressful time for patients, and they may forget to disclose that they have diabetes or they may not know, which can cause serious complications during the course of the care. This challenge offers participants the chance to see what itâ€™s like to tackle a real-world issue while enhancing their technical skills.
